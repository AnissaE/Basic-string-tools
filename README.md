# Software_deployement

## Introduction
This is a project given to 4 year Bio-Informatics and Modelling students of INSA of Lyon. In our Software Deployement courses, we were asked to deploye a package.

This [git repository](https://github.com/AnissaE/Software_deployement.git) is where you can find our "Play with Words" software. We wrote for you some functions in Python3 so that you can play a little with some words (string type). 

## Coded functions

We coded five functions so you may play with strings. They are :
- char_freq : Get the number of time each character of your string can be found, taking into account if you want so the case of the character.
- are_anagrams : Find whether or not two strings are anagrams.
- letters_only : Keep only the letters of your string.
- remove : Remove the first occurrence of a string X in a string Y.
- remove_all : Remove all occurrences of a string X in a string Y.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You do not need so many software to have our code working. Just make sure that you do have Python3.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
