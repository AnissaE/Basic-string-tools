# Software_deployement

## Introduction
This is a project given to 4 year Bio-Informatics and Modelling students of INSA of Lyon. In our Software Deployement courses, we were asked to deploye a python module.

This [git repository](https://github.com/AnissaE/Software_deployement.git) is where you can find our "Play with Words" software. We wrote for you some functions in Python3 so that you can play a little with some words (string type). 

## Coded functions

You may play with words by using a few functions we coded. They are :
- char_freq : Get the number of time each character of your string can be found, taking into account if you want so the case of the character.
- are_anagrams : Find whether or not two strings are anagrams.
- letters_only : Keep only the letters of your string.
- remove : Remove the first occurrence of a string X in a string Y.
- remove_all : Remove all occurrences of a string X in a string Y.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

First, open a terminal in the folder where you want to download the module. You can then write the following instructions:

```
git clone git@github.com:AnissaE/Software_deployement.git
#OU PARCE QUE JE SUIS PAS SURE

import bstools
bstools.FUNCTION(PARAMETERS)

```


### Prerequisites

Just make sure that you do have Python3. You do not need any other software to have our module working. 

```
Give examples
```


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
