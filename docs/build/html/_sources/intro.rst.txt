*******************
Why this project ?
*******************



We are three master students at INSA Lyon (France) in bio-informatics and modeling : 


 * Armande Cirot
 * Claire Lemonnier
 * Anissa El marrahi


We created this package with one module : `bstools <bstools.html>`_ for our software deployement project . The aim of this project was to make us discover all the steps from the development to release of a software. The step of deployment is very important, because we have to bring a consistent documentation for the user and bring all the tools that allow a good use of the package. 

bstools is for Basic String tools because these are tools  in order to manipulate strings in Python in a simple way. It is also a private joke about our department at school that is called Biosciences (BS)....It's ok if you didn't understand the joke =)
